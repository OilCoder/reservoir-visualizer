# Document

Generate a complete documentation file for a project module.
Follow the standards defined in `docs-style.md` rule.

## Procedure

### 1. Identify the target

- If the user passed `$ARGUMENTS`, use it as the target.
- Read the complete source file to understand what it does.

### 2. Create the document

- **Location: `docs/`**
- Name: `NN_<slug>.md` following `file-naming.md`
- Examples: `01_las_loader.md`, `02_3d_renderer.md`, `03_llm_copilot.md`

### 3. Required sections

```markdown
# <Module name>

## Purpose
One sentence describing the module's role.

## Workflow
Description of the sequence of operations.
Use numbered steps or descriptive text.
Include a Mermaid diagram if the flow is complex.

## Inputs and Outputs
- param_name (type): description
- return (type): description

## Mathematical explanation (if applicable)
Formulas or logic in LaTeX/pseudocode.

## Code reference
Source: <path to source file>
```

## Rules

- Document only what exists in the current code — no plans or assumptions.
- Write clearly and concisely. Short paragraphs, examples when helpful.
- Each document must reflect the actual behavior of the code.
- Avoid TODOs and speculative notes.
- If the module has dependencies, list them.
- **Language: English.**
- Remember that `docs/` is read from Windows/Obsidian — keep Markdown clean and standard.
